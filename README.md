#### By Eddie Harris


## Project Description

Project: Online Chess

##This project is still being worked on

Features added (Finished):
- All pieces can only make legal moves.
- All pieces can take an opponent's piece if it is a legal move.
- Both Kings can castle to the right or left. Can only castle if it is a legal move (i.e not in check).
- If a pawn reaches the opponent's back rank, a modal will open and prompt the player to select a bishop, knight, rook or queen to switch out with the pawn.
- 

- THE GAME IS NOT CURRENTLY TURN BASED. BOTH WHITE AND BLACK PIECES CAN MOVE OUT OF TURN. This allows for quicker and easier testing of whether a feature is working correctly.

Features to be added:

Allow two users to play chess against each other on two different computers.

- Each move and chess piece position will be saved to a database. The board will populate based on the database.
- A chess clock that limits the amount of time each player can take between moves. If the clock expires, the player resigns the game.
- A chat feature that allows players to post to a chat board during the game.
- A live feed that lists each players previous moves.
- Allow users to play multiple games at once.
